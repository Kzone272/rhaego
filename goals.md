# Goals

- [ ] Global Illumination of some sort
  - probably something like generating a photon map, then doing a final gather step for each pixel
  - maybe some other strategy, currently unclear
- [ ] Realtime renderer of raytracer output
  - OpenGL?
  - Maybe time to get a taste of Vulkan?
  - Probably whatever's easiest
