# Goals

- [ ] Global Illumination of some sort
  - probably something like generating a photon map, then doing a final gather step for each pixel
  - maybe some other strategy, currently unclear
- [ ] Realtime renderer of raytracer output
  - OpenGL?
    - yeah most likely
  - ~~Maybe time to get a taste of Vulkan?~~
    - Vulkan doesn't suuport OSX dummy
  - Metal?
    - possible, unlikely
  - Probably whatever's easiest
